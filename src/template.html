                <b>How are laws passed in your colony?</b>
                <br />
                Laws on the colony will largely be pre determined on Earth
                before the mission, but any laws that will need to be passed
                will be passed by either a full consensus or a vast
                supermajority of 90% or more. Because there are so few people on
                mars and the cooperation of the entire crew is so vital to
                sustaining the colony, a consensus is ideal as it means that
                everyone will be in agreement with one another. Additionally,
                because there are so little people, the drawbacks of consensus
                such as ineffectiveness in large numbers will not apply.
                However, the drawbacks to this system are that in moments where
                instantaneous decisions must be made, this approach is much too
                slow. As such, there will also be a mission commander that will
                be in charge of all operations and activities of the crew.
                Consensus will only be required for making laws.
                <br />
                <br />

                <b
                  >How have you organized the executive, legislative and
                  judicial branches?</b
                ><br />
                The executive branch will simply consist of the entire crew.
                Each crew member will have their own assigned responsibilities
                and duties, such as maintaining water supply or doing surface
                maintenance EVA’s. As such, they will each function as a sort of
                “cabinet minister”, and together they will make up the
                “cabinet”. The mission commander will serve as either a prime
                minister or a dictator, with authority over the processes that
                take place. Similarly, the legislative branch will also consist
                of just crew members. Each person will serve as a Member of
                Parliament, and every person will participate in the “House of
                Commons” to make and revise laws. Because the ability to have
                your voice heard in such a small group is so important,
                punishments during the mission may involve being banned from
                participating in these sessions. However, because the judicial
                system may be dealing with crew members who have violated some
                sort of conduct, it will operate a bit differently than the
                other two branches. When deciding judgement for crew members
                that have broken the law, the crew member in question will of
                course not be permitted to take part in the decision. However,
                they will be allowed to state and argue their case. All other
                members will function as judges, deciding whether or not the
                person is guilty or not and what punishments to give. If no
                agreement is reached for any of the branches or under other
                circumstances, the mission commander has the power to override
                any other crew member’s decisions and make the decision
                themselves. This system will result in high cooperation rates
                and very effective communication, as all crew members are very
                active in the governmentation of the colony and play multiple
                roles in its different branches. When making laws, easy and
                consistent agreements will likely be reached and carrying out
                the laws is easy to oversee and regulate due to how small the
                government of the colony is. However, the mission commander’s
                power may result in them abusing their authority and
                establishing a dictatorship, and corruption amongst the crew is
                also likely. This governmentation system relies heavily on the
                crew member’s own moral values and the ability for the crew to
                make responsible and mature decisions on their own. For this
                reason, the system will not work with too many people or without
                rigorous screening when selecting crew members.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b
                  >How does your colony choose members of the legislative
                  branch?</b
                >
                <br />
                The “prime Minister” of the colony will be predetermined on
                Earth, and a rank of power will also be decided. Any other crew
                members will automatically be selected as Members of Parliament,
                should they wish to contribute in the making and revising of
                laws. This way, all crew members will be able to participate in
                law making and no one will feel that their opinion is left out.
                However, as the number of people increases, the system becomes
                more and more inefficient and unrealistic, so it only works with
                small crew numbers. As stated before, this system also relies on
                the crew’s own moral values and social responsibilities to
                function. Because everyone gets a voice and there are so few
                people, crew members have a large amount of influence over
                decisions that are made. Mutiny is also possible, and so
                additional measures must be taken to prevent this.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b
                  >How does your colony choose members of the executive
                  branch?</b
                >
                <br />
                Tasks and responsibilities during the mission will be
                predetermined on Earth, and on Mars each crew member will serve
                as a “cabinet Minister” of their respective areas. Again, the
                mission commander will serve as the prime minister and will
                oversee the roles and responsibilities of all crew members. This
                system is extremely efficient, as with small groups of people
                there simply isn't enough manpower to organize large committees
                and organizations. With so many tasks to take care of and so
                little people to do those tasks on Mars, the best option is also
                the simplest- to have each person cover all responsibilities for
                their departments. Some cons to this however, are that there is
                a high risk of error in the system as only one person is in
                charge of each category. As such, there are less people to
                double check processes and decisions, and a higher risk of
                failure. Again, this system relies heavily on the ability of the
                crew, and so the crew selected will need to be extremely
                capable.

                <br />
                <b>What role will political parties play in your colony?</b>
                <br />
                Political parties will likely play little to no role in our
                colony as there will simply not be enough people to form any
                sort of party. Political parties often act as a medium between
                the people and the government, but in a system where the people
                are the government and the government are the people, this is
                not needed. This will make the system less complicated and more
                efficient, but will also need adjustments once our colony;s
                population increases. Would there be any government control over
                your media - how free is your media to report issues in your
                society? What are the pros and cons to this? The only likely
                source of media on our colony would probably be data
                transmissions back to Earth, in which case all issues and
                information must be relayed over freely without any censorship.
                This will ensure mission control knows as much information about
                the status of the colony as possible should any issues arise.
                However, this is a flawed system as the crew themselves control
                all information output to Earth and any member could simply
                refuse to relay information. To keep this from happening, the
                system relies on the morals of the crew and the threat of
                punishment once back on Earth from mission control.

            <h3>How we deal with crimes</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Rehabilitative system which includes:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Having the victim(if applicable) &amp; offender work towards a
                  solution together.
                </li>
                <li>Focused on making amends</li>
                <li>No unrelated punishment, only natural consequences</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    For example, if the crew member was caught stealing food,
                    then they would have their food storage access privileges
                    revoked for a certain period of time
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    However, they would not have any other privileges (such as
                    living quarter access, security room access, etc) revoked
                    just to &lsquo;punish&rsquo; them.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </ul>

              <strong
                >Look at the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms - do you
                want to apply these same rights, or do you want to create
                different rights for your people.&nbsp; Are there some rights
                you don&rsquo;t want to give colonists because this is a
                different society and environment from what Canadians
                experience. You may want to take the rights that exist in Canada
                and adapt them somewhat to better fit the needs of your

              <li>
                Since we have Unity and Equality as central goals, we should
                have similar rights for everyone
              </li>
              <li>
                There should be very few special needs as everyone on the
                mission must be capable (No disabilities, backgrounds
                don&rsquo;t matter much)

              <li>
                Although perhaps <em>if</em> colonists ever started reproducing,
                the mothers would need some time to recoup.&nbsp;
              </li>

                Maybe we should send them back to Earth before they get too old
                to be productive, or else they will take up many more resources
                than necessary. Maybe even a semi dystopian society where we get
                rid of them&hellip;
